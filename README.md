Global infos:
Creative Technologist Engineer Master first semester Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics Assignment.
Contains a simple prototype graphical user interface to launch python scripts, some example python scripts and .csv coordinates files handler for Bitcraze Crazyflie drones.
The drones used here use the Lighthouse positioning system for onboard positioning, therefore, if you want to adapt it to another positioning system, you have to adapt the position regulation method.

Included Python scripts:
Keyboard control and voice control originally uploaded on the labs github https://github.com/DeVinci-Innovation-Center/THEDRONELAB
Hand gesture recognition.

CSV flight uses 3 dimensional coordinates from a csv file to feed the drone positions to achieve, in order.

In order to get the scripts to work from the gui, a drone radio adress is usually needed.
